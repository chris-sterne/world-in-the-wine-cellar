WORLD IN THE WINE CELLAR
-------------------------

This program is a world creator for the exploration puzzle game "Enigma in
the Wine Cellar".  This version for Linux OS is still under development, so
it has limited functionality and stability.

AUTOTOOLS BUILD PACKAGE

The shell command './configure && make' should configure the build system
and then build this package.  No installation is done.  The resulting binary
file can be run with the shell command 'src/world-in-the-wine-celler'.
